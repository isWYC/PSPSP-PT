# Datasets from Hongbo Li, Qianrong, Hui and Yuechen Wang, (2024, working paper), Preemptive software project scheduling considering personality traits.
## HA+EDA.xlsx
The document contains five worksheets.
1. **ha**: This worksheet includes results from solving various combinations of task selection priority rules and employee assignment priority rules (a total of 20 combinations) for each of the 320 instances. Each row records the performance of a specific priority rule combination on an instance, totaling 6,400 data points.
2. **EDA**: This worksheet presents the results of applying EDA to each instance, with each row representing one instance.
3. **ha_eda_pivot_table**: This is a pivot table that compares the performance differences between heuristic algorithms and EDA under different priority rule combinations.
4. **Discussion on Priority Rules**: Compare the performance of the heuristic algorithm under different priority rule combinations to select the optimal combination of priority rules.
5. **ha_EDA**: Summarizes the results of the heuristic algorithm and EDA, used for creating a pivot table (ha_eda_pivot_table).

## Sensitivity analysis
The document contains two worksheets.
1. **H_PivotTable**: The pivot table shows the impact of workload and order intensity on the algorithm when the matching coefficient is generally high.
2. **L_PivotTable**: The pivot table shows the impact of workload and order intensity on the algorithm when the number of matches is generally low.
3. **ha_eda**: Used to create the first two pivot tables (summarizing the solution results of the heuristic algorithm and EDA).
